[1mNAME[0m
       su - run a command with substitute user and group ID

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1msu [22m[options] [[1m-[22m] [[4muser[24m [[4margument[24m...]]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msu [22mallows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.

       When  called  without  arguments, [1msu [22mdefaults to running an interactive
       shell as [4mroot[24m.

       For backward compatibility, [1msu  [22mdefaults  to  not  change  the  current
       directory  and  to  only  set  the environment variables [1mHOME [22mand [1mSHELL[0m
       (plus [1mUSER [22mand [1mLOGNAME [22mif the target [4muser[24m is not root).  It  is  recom‚Äê
       mended  to always use the [1m--login [22moption (instead of its shortcut [1m-[22m) to
       avoid side effects caused by mixing environments.

       This version of [1msu [22muses PAM for  authentication,  account  and  session
       management.   Some  configuration options found in other [1msu [22mimplementa‚Äê
       tions, such as support for a wheel group, have  to  be  configured  via
       PAM.

       [1msu  [22mis mostly designed for unprivileged users, the recommended solution
       for privileged users (e.g. scripts executed by root) is to use non-set-
       user-ID  command  [1mrunuser[22m(1)  that  does not require authentication and
       provide separate PAM configuration. If the PAM session is not  required
       at all then the recommend solution is to use command [1msetpriv[22m(1).

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-c[22m, [1m--command[22m=[4mcommand[0m
              Pass [4mcommand[24m to the shell with the [1m-c [22moption.

       [1m-f[22m, [1m--fast[0m
              Pass  [1m-f [22mto the shell, which may or may not be useful, depending
              on the shell.

       [1m-g[22m, [1m--group[22m=[4mgroup[0m
              Specify the primary group.  This option is available to the root
              user only.

       [1m-G[22m, [1m--supp-group[22m=[4mgroup[0m
              Specify  a  supplemental group.  This option is available to the
              root user only.  The first specified supplementary group is also
              used as a primary group if the option [1m--group [22mis unspecified.

       [1m-[22m, [1m-l[22m, [1m--login[0m
              Start  the shell as a login shell with an environment similar to
              a real login:

                 o      clears all the environment variables except [1mTERM[0m

                 o      initializes the  environment  variables  [1mHOME[22m,  [1mSHELL[22m,
                        [1mUSER[22m, [1mLOGNAME[22m, and [1mPATH[0m

                 o      changes to the target user's home directory

                 o      sets  argv[0] of the shell to '[1m-[22m' in order to make the
                        shell a login shell

       [1m-m[22m, [1m-p[22m, [1m--preserve-environment[0m
              Preserve the entire environment, i.e.  it  does  not  set  [1mHOME[22m,
              [1mSHELL[22m,  [1mUSER  [22mnor [1mLOGNAME[22m.  This option is ignored if the option
              [1m--login [22mis specified.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--pty[0m
              Create pseudo-terminal for the session. The independent terminal
              provides  better  security  as user does not share terminal with
              the original session.  This allow to avoid TIOCSTI ioctl  termi‚Äê
              nal injection and another security attacks against terminal file
              descriptors. The all session is also possible to move  to  back‚Äê
              ground  (e.g.  "su  --pty  -  usename -c application &"). If the
              pseudo-terminal is enabled then su  command  works  as  a  proxy
              between the sessions (copy stdin and stdout).

              This  feature  is EXPERIMENTAL for now and may be removed in the
              next releases.

       [1m-s[22m, [1m--shell[22m=[4mshell[0m
              Run the specified [4mshell[24m instead of the default.   The  shell  to
              run is selected according to the following rules, in order:

                 o      the shell specified with [1m--shell[0m

                 o      the shell specified in the environment variable [1mSHELL[22m,
                        if the [1m--preserve-environment [22moption is used

                 o      the shell listed in the passwd  entry  of  the  target
                        user

                 o      /bin/sh

              If  the  target  user has a restricted shell (i.e. not listed in
              /etc/shells), the [1m--shell [22moption and the [1mSHELL [22menvironment vari‚Äê
              ables are ignored unless the calling user is root.

       [1m--session-command=[4m[22mcommand[0m

[1mNOTES[0m
       For  security reasons [1msu [22malways logs failed log-in attempts to the btmp
       file, but it does not write to the lastlog file at all.  This  solution
       allows to control [1msu [22mbehavior by PAM configuration.  If you want to use
       the pam_lastlog module to print warning  message  about  failed  log-in
       attempts  then the pam_lastlog has to be configured to update the last‚Äê
       log file as well. For example by:

              session  required  pam_lastlog.so nowtmp

[1mHISTORY[0m
       This [1msu [22mcommand was derived from coreutils' [1msu[22m, which was based  on  an
       implementation  by  David MacKenzie. The util-linux has been refactored
       by Karel Zak.

[1mAVAILABILITY[0m
       The su command is part of the util-linux package and is available  from
       Linux   Kernel   Archive  ‚ü®https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-
